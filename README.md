         issues talked about by developers

There are many small factors that slowly and gradually harm a developer’s projects. They are not immediately destructive. Most of them only do long-term damage. 
To avoid being one of the victims, you should embrace the fundamental laws of software. 
This mindset will help you make better decisions in your daily programming journey.

---
1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software:
First of all, you should understand the purpose of the software. 
When you are making decisions about software always keep this in mind: How we can help? You can even prioritize feature requests this way.
---
2. 
The Goals of Software Design:
Every programmer is a designer.
This brings us to the most important goal of the software design:
1. created and maintained as easily.
2. Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
----
3. (Mis)understanding:

understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer

---
4. Simplicity:

A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs.
The truth is that if other developers who read your code can understand it easily it means that you are doing good.

---
5. Complexity:

Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. — Brian Kernighan
As a developer, your first behavior should be resistance to (unnecessary) change.
Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.

----

6. Maintenance:

All changes require maintenance.
Simplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance. 
It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.

---
7. Consistency:

Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don’t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.

---

8. Prioritizing:

- The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change
- The desirability of a change 
- The value of a change

---

9. Solving Problems (Think before acting):

 Give your brain some time to analyze the problem and process:
- The first step is understanding. Know exactly what is being asked. 
- The second step is planning
- The third step is dividing the problem to solve it

----
10. Good enough is fine:

Whether creating a new project or adding a feature to existing system developers tend to plan everything out in detail from the beginning.
1. Start small, improve it, then extend.
2. The incremental design should be your guide.
3. Improve the now-existing system’s design so you can add other operations also.

----
11. Predictions:

Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
